Shoebill
========

A Macintosh II emulator that runs A/UX (and A/UX only). 

Shoebill is an all-new, BSD-licensed Macintosh II emulator designed from the ground up with the singular goal of running A/UX. 

Shoebill requires a OS X, a Macintosh II, IIx or IIcx ROM, and a disk image with A/UX installed.
